Exploratory Data Analysis on Heart Disease Dataset
📖 Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset. Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death globally. Through this analysis, we aim to explore patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the dataset that could provide insights into the factors contributing to heart disease.

🔍 Importance of EDA
EDA is a crucial step in any data analysis or machine learning project. It helps to:

Understand the Dataset: Analyze distributions, detect outliers, and identify missing values.
Generate Hypotheses: Discover relationships and patterns between variables.
Prepare Data: Ensure the dataset is ready for modeling by cleaning and transforming it.
Visualize Insights: Use graphical techniques to uncover trends and communicate findings effectively.
🛠️ Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Seaborn: For advanced visualization of data trends and patterns.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
SciPy: For statistical analysis.

📊 Key Insights
The dataset contains 303 rows and 14 columns, with the target column indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
Key features like chest pain type (cp) and maximum heart rate achieved (thalach) showed mild positive correlations with the presence of heart disease.
Outliers were detected in variables such as cholesterol (chol) and resting blood pressure (trestbps), necessitating further investigation.
Heatmaps and Pair Plots were instrumental in discovering correlations between features.
